# 🚀 C++ & DSA Projects

This repository showcases mini-projects and applied implementations for each module of my C++ & Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) roadmap.

Each project is built to:

Apply concepts from the module in practical or real-world scenarios

Strengthen problem-solving and coding skills

Serve as a portfolio of hands-on projects for interviews and open-source contributions

#### *This repo complements my C++ DSA Practice Codes repo by showing how theory converts into real-world applications.*

Practice Repo → Concepts & problem-solving.

Projects Repo → Applied learning & portfolio-ready showcases.

### 📌 Note

Projects are organized by module/topic.

Each project is kept modular and beginner-friendly.

Future updates will add more projects as I progress through all 62 modules.
